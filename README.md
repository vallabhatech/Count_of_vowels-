🔤 Count of Vowels
📌 Project Overview
"Count of Vowels" is a simple yet elegant web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool takes user input (a string of text) and dynamically counts the number of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) present in the input. The project showcases how basic front-end technologies can be combined to create a useful and interactive web utility.

🚀 Features
🔎 Real-time vowel count as you type

🎨 Responsive and modern user interface

🔤 Case-insensitive vowel detection

✨ Clean and beginner-friendly codebase

📱 Mobile-first design

🧠 How It Works
User enters a sentence or word in the input box.

JavaScript captures the input using an event listener.

Each character is analyzed; if it matches a vowel (a, e, i, o, u – both upper and lowercase), it is counted.

The total count is updated and displayed in real-time on the screen.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Markup for layout and input form

CSS3 – For styling and responsiveness

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic for detecting and counting vowels
